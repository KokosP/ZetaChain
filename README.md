__Zeta Chain__ is the official public poll that captures the omnichain, universal smart contracts and messaging across wide scopes. It solves the problems of "cross-chains" and "multi-chains" and aims to open the cryptographic and global financial ecosystem to everyone.


## Wallet for work

For work, we will use the Metamask wallet. We go to the [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) website, install the extension for the Chrome browser.

Once installed, you will need to go to your wallet and enable testnets.
